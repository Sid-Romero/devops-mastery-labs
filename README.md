# Docker Mastery Labs

A comprehensive collection of hands-on labs designed to master Docker, Kubernetes, and related DevOps technologies. Each lab is a self-contained mini-project with clear objectives, specific constraints, and validation criteria. Progress from beginner to production expert through practical, real-world scenarios. 
This readme is generated by Copilot. The 5 first labs too. 

## Labs Overview

### Beginner Level (Labs 1-5)

Build foundational Docker knowledge with practical, hands-on projects.

| Lab | Title | Concepts | Status |
|-----|-------|----------|--------|
| [01](lab-01-multistage-node/) | Multi-stage Node.js Build | Multi-stage builds, optimization, layer caching | Not Started |
| [02](lab-02-python-env-secrets/) | Python Environment & Secrets | Environment variables, secrets management, configuration | Not Started |
| [03](lab-03-postgres-volumes/) | PostgreSQL & Volumes | Data persistence, volumes, backup/restore | Not Started |
| [04](lab-04-network-isolation/) | Network Isolation | Docker networking, service isolation, DNS | Not Started |
| [05](lab-05-mern-compose/) | MERN Stack with Compose | Multi-container orchestration, full-stack apps | Not Started |

### Rest of the Labs
The rest of the labs have random level attributions. The goal being to cover most of the most trending Devops subjets through labs.
Topics being in general, production deployments, CI/CD, and DevOps integration, enterprise orchestration and cloud-native architectures.

## Progress Tracking

## Automated Lab Generation Pipeline

This repository utilizes an automated pipeline to continuously generate new hands-on labs using AI technology and web scraping.

### How Labs Are Created

The lab generation process follows a multi-stage pipeline:

#### 1. Content Discovery
The system scrapes trending DevOps content from multiple authoritative sources:
- Dev.to RSS feeds
- GitHub Trending repositories
- CNCF Blog
- Reddit communities (r/devops, r/kubernetes, r/docker, r/ansible)
- Hacker News (filtered for DevOps topics)
- Medium DevOps tags

#### 2. Topic Selection
From the scraped content, the system:
- Extracts relevant topics and technologies
- Identifies key concepts and learning opportunities
- Selects topics that align with the repository's learning progression
- Ensures diversity across Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD, and Ansible

#### 3. AI-Powered Generation
Using Google Gemini AI, the system generates complete lab structures including:
- Comprehensive objectives and learning goals
- Step-by-step task descriptions
- Validation criteria and verification commands
- Hints and bonus challenges
- Relevant documentation links
- Difficulty assessment (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert)

#### 4. Lab Creation
The file creator component:
- Generates the lab directory structure
- Creates README.md with complete instructions
- Sets up starter files and solution directories
- Assigns sequential lab numbers
- Organizes labs by difficulty level

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The lab generation is automated through GitHub Actions:

**Schedule:**
- Runs automatically at intervals of 3 or 5 hours (runs at 00:00, 03:00, 08:00, 11:00, 16:00, 19:00 UTC)
- Switches to daily generation once 50 labs are reached
- Can be manually triggered with technology specification

**Process:**
1. Checks existing lab count
2. Determines if generation should proceed
3. Scrapes current DevOps content
4. Selects topic and technology
5. Generates lab using AI
6. Creates lab files in repository
7. Commits and pushes new lab

**Technologies Supported:**
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- ArgoCD
- Ansible

### Manual Lab Generation

Developers can manually generate labs using the Python scripts:

```bash
cd scripts
pip install -r requirements.txt
python lab_generator.py --technology docker
```

Available options:
- `--technology <tech>` - Force specific technology
- `--skip-scrape` - Use fallback topics
- `--dry-run` - Test without creating files
- `--test` - Run local tests

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed documentation.
